    <p id='title'><b>Statistical Tornado Model Information</b></p>
    <p id='desc'>
        The tornado and related impact data are generated via a statistical model that utilizes historical
        distributions to simulate tornadoes and their possible impacts. The model uses the SPC probabilistic 
        tornado forecast (on a grid spacing of 5 km) as input. Using the statistical properties of tornado ratings 
        and path lengths within various SPC outlook categories, the model runs 10K simulations of the valid forecast period,
        randomly generating tornadoes with ratings and path lengths. These tornado paths are then overlaid on gridded 
        infrastructure data to estimate potential exposure in each simulation. From the 10K
        simulations, tornado and impact distributions are generated.

    <p id='notes'><b>Notes:</b> 
        Direction of movement is randomly generated from a normal distribution centered on 230deg. This is sub-optimal, 
        of course, and future efforts are geared towards developing methods to more accurately represent potential 
        tornado motion for individual events. Another focus of future work is the development of timing information for 
        each tornado.
