    <p id='title'><b>Expected Wind/Hail Machine Learning Model</b></p>
    <p id='desc'>
        This model predicts the number of damaging wind and severe hail reports to be expected for the valid forecast 
        period for the chosen CWA. Currently, the model makes predictions for FWD and neighboring CWAs, but will be expanded 
        and/or updated pending feedback and review.<br><br>
        A gradient boosting machine-learning model was trained on approximately 30K samples from 2018-20, with features 
        incorporating the area and population count under various outlook probabilities, as well as the time of year and 
        the particular CWA. By doing so, the model attempts to account for CWA and population biases in predicting reports.
        The goal is to provide a proxy for how busy a particular WFO can expect to be.<br><br>
        By hovering over the predicted total, a pop-up shows how the expected number compares to climatology for that 
        particular CWA.

    <p id='notes'><b>Notes:</b> 
        The model predicts the number of filtered reports (and only for severe hail and damaging wind), 
        not the number of raw reports.
